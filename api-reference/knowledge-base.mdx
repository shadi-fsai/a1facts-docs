title: "KnowledgeBase"
description: "The KnowledgeBase class is the main entry point for interacting with the a1facts knowledge base."
---

The `KnowledgeBase` class is the primary interface for working with `a1facts`. It encapsulates the ontology, the knowledge graph, and the knowledge acquirer, providing a unified access point to all the functionalities of the framework.

To get started, you need to create an instance of the `KnowledgeBase` class, which requires configuration files for the ontology and knowledge sources.

## `__init__`

Initializes a new instance of the `KnowledgeBase` class.

<RequestExample>
```python
from a1facts import KnowledgeBase

kb = KnowledgeBase(
    name="my-knowledge-base",
    ontology_config_file="ontology.yaml",
    knowledge_sources_config_file="sources.yaml",
    use_neo4j=False
)
```
</RequestExample>

### Parameters

<ParamField body="name" type="str" required>
  The name of the knowledge base.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="ontology_config_file" type="str" required>
  The path to the ontology configuration file.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="knowledge_sources_config_file" type="str" required>
  The path to the knowledge sources configuration file.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="use_neo4j" type="bool" default="False">
  If `True`, the knowledge base will use a Neo4j backend. Otherwise, it will use an in-memory graph.
</ParamField>

---

## `get_tools`

Returns a list of tools that can be used by an AI agent to interact with the knowledge base. These tools allow the agent to query for information and acquire new knowledge.

<RequestExample>
```python
tools = kb.get_tools()
query_tool, acquire_tool = tools
```
</RequestExample>

### Returns

<ResponseField name="tools" type="list">
  A list containing two tool functions: `query_tool` and `acquire_tool`.
</ResponseField>

---

### `query_tool`

The `query_tool` allows an agent to retrieve precise information from the knowledge graph by translating a natural language query into a graph traversal.

**Parameters**
<ParamField body="query" type="str" required>
  The natural language query to execute against the knowledge graph.
</ParamField>

**Returns**
<ResponseField name="result" type="any">
  The result of the query from the knowledge graph. The type of the result will depend on the query.
</ResponseField>

---

### `acquire_tool`

The `acquire_tool` enables an agent to ingest new information into the knowledge graph from the configured knowledge sources. It takes a query, fetches relevant data, and updates the graph according to the ontology.

**Parameters**
<ParamField body="query" type="str" required>
  The query to send to the knowledge acquirer. This will guide the data ingestion process.
</ParamField>

**Returns**
<ResponseField name="result" type="any">
  The result from the knowledge acquirer, which may include a summary of the ingested data.
</ResponseField>
