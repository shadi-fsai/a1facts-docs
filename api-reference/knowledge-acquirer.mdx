description: "The `KnowledgeAcquirer` class is responsible for enriching and updating the knowledge graph with validated information from various knowledge sources."
---

The `KnowledgeAcquirer` class uses an agent to interact with defined knowledge sources, acquire new information, and update the knowledge graph.

### `__init__(self, graph: KnowledgeGraph, ontology: KnowledgeOntology, knowledge_sources_config_file: str)`

Initializes a new instance of the `KnowledgeAcquirer` class.

<RequestExample>
```python
from a1facts.enrichment import KnowledgeAcquirer
from a1facts.graph import KnowledgeGraph
from a1facts.ontology import KnowledgeOntology

ontology = KnowledgeOntology(ontology_file="ontology.yaml")
kg = KnowledgeGraph(ontology=ontology)
acquirer = KnowledgeAcquirer(
    graph=kg,
    ontology=ontology,
    knowledge_sources_config_file="sources.yaml",
    disable_exa=False
)
```
</RequestExample>

**Parameters:**

-   `graph` (KnowledgeGraph): The knowledge graph to be updated.
-   `ontology` (KnowledgeOntology): The ontology that defines the structure of the knowledge graph.
-   `knowledge_sources_config_file` (str): The path to the YAML file that configures the knowledge sources.
-   `disable_exa` (bool): If `True`, the knowledge base will not use Exa search for knowledge acquisition. Defaults to `False`.

### `acquire(self, query: str)`

Executes a query to acquire new knowledge from the configured sources.

<RequestExample>
```python
result = acquirer.acquire("Find the latest financial report for Apple Inc.")
print(result)
```
