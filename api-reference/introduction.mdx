The `KnowledgeBase` class is the primary interface for working with `a1facts`. It encapsulates the ontology, the knowledge graph, and the knowledge acquirer.

### Core Concepts

-   **KnowledgeBase**: The main class that provides access to all the functionalities of `a1facts`.
-   **Ontology**: Defines the schema of your knowledge graph.
-   **Knowledge Graph**: Stores and manages your structured data.
-   **Knowledge Acquirer**: Fetches and ingests data from external sources.

### Getting Started

To start using `a1facts`, you first need to create an instance of the `KnowledgeBase` class.
