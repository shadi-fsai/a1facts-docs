<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the Repository">
        Open your terminal and run the following commands to clone the repository and navigate into the library directory:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/shadi-fsai/a1facts.git
        cd a1facts/lib
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install Dependencies">
        Next, create a virtual environment and install the required packages.
        
        **1. Create the virtual environment:**
        ```bash
        uv venv
        ```
        
        **2. Activate the virtual environment:**

            <Tab title="Windows">
                ```powershell
                .venv\Scripts\activate
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
                ```bash
                source .venv/bin/activate
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        **3. Install dependencies:**
        ```bash
        uv pip install -e .
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Your Environment">
        You'll need to provide credentials to connect to your Neo4j database and other services.

        1.  Create a `.env` file in the `a1facts/lib` directory.
        2.  Add your API keys and, optionally, your Neo4j credentials to the file:
            ```dotenv .env
            OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
            EXA_API_KEY="your_exa_api_key"

            # Optional: Add if you want to use Neo4j
            NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
            NEO4J_AUTH="your_neo4j_password"
            ```
        3.  (Optional) Configure logging by adding the following environment variables:
            ```dotenv .env
            # Log levels: 0 = off, 1 = user, 2 = system/user
            A1FACTS_LOG_LEVEL="1" 
            A1FACTS_LOG_FILE="a1facts.log"
            ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
