title: "Clinical Trials Agent"
description: "This example demonstrates how to use `a1facts` to build an agent that can answer questions about clinical trials."
---

This agent can answer questions about clinical trials by using a knowledge graph and external data sources.

### How it Works

The agent is built using the following components:

-   **`trialsagent.py`**: The main script that creates and runs the agent. It initializes the `a1facts` tool, which acts as the bridge between the agent and the knowledge graph.
-   **`trials.yaml`**: This file defines the schema of our knowledge graph. It specifies the types of entities (e.g., `ClinicalTrial`, `Drug`, `Condition`) and the relationships between them.
-   **`sources.yaml`**: This file configures the external data sources.

When you run `trialsagent.py`, it initializes an agent with the `a1facts` tool. The agent is then asked a complex query about clinical trials. The `a1facts` tool uses the information from the `trials.yaml` and `sources.yaml` to understand the query, fetch relevant data, and then provides an answer.

### Running the Example

1.  **Set up your environment:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of this project and add your 

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=
    EXA_API_KEY=
    ```

2.  **Run the agent:**

    Navigate to the `a1facts/cookbook/clinical_trials` directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    uv run trialsagent.py
    ```

This will run the agent and print the answer to the query in the console.
