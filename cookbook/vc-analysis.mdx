This example provides the building blocks for creating a VC analysis agent. It is not a runnable example, but it contains the `yaml` files that define the ontology and data sources.

### Components

-   **`funding.yaml`**: This file defines the schema of our knowledge graph. It specifies the types of entities (e.g., `Company`, `Investor`, `FundingRound`) and the relationships between them.
-   **`sources.yaml`**: This file configures the external data sources.
