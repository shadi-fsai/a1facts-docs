title: "VC Analysis"
description: "This example provides the building blocks for creating a Venture Capital (VC) analysis agent."
---

This example provides the `YAML` files that define the ontology and data sources for a VC analysis agent. While this is not a runnable example, it serves as a starting point for building an agent that can track companies, investors, and funding rounds.

    <Card title="`funding.yaml`" icon="sitemap">
        This file defines the schema of the knowledge graph. It specifies the types of entities (e.g., `Company`, `Investor`, `FundingRound`) and the relationships between them, creating a structured foundation for VC data.
    </Card>
    <Card title="`sources.yaml`" icon="cloud-download">
        This file is a template for configuring the external data sources you would need to populate the knowledge graph, such as Crunchbase, PitchBook, or other financial data APIs.

<Info>
  To turn this into a runnable example, you would need to implement a Python script (similar to `infoagent.py` in the stock analysis example) that creates and runs the agent, as well as the functions to interact with your chosen data sources.
