The knowledge graph is where your structured data, defined by the ontology, is stored. `a1facts` uses a graph database to store entities and their relationships, allowing for complex queries and analysis.

### Neo4j Backend

`a1facts` supports [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) as a backend for the knowledge graph. When you initialize a `KnowledgeBase` with `use_neo4j=True`, `a1facts` will connect to your Neo4j instance and store the data there. This provides a robust and scalable solution for managing your knowledge base.

### Querying the Graph

The knowledge graph can be queried using natural language. When an agent receives a query, it uses the `query_tool` (see [API Reference](/api-reference/knowledge-base)) to translate the natural language query into a graph traversal. The results are then returned to the agent.

This process ensures that the agent's responses are grounded in the factual data stored in the knowledge graph, eliminating hallucinations and providing precise, verifiable answers.
