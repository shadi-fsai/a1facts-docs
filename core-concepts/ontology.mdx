The ontology is a declarative `YAML` file that defines the structure of your knowledge graph. It specifies the types of entities and relationships that can exist in your graph, acting as a schema to ensure data consistency and to guide the query generation process.

By defining a clear and explicit ontology, you enable `a1facts` to validate incoming data and construct precise queries.

## Example

Here is an example of an ontology for financial analysis, taken from the [Stock Analysis](/cookbook/stock-analysis) cookbook example.

```yaml company.yaml
name: company_info
description: "Ontology for company information"
entities:
  - name: Company
    description: "A company"
    properties:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: "The name of the company"
      - name: ticker
        type: string
        description: "The stock ticker of the company"
      - name: description
        type: string
        description: "A description of the company"
  - name: Product_Service
    description: "A product or service offered by a company"
    properties:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: "The name of the product or service"
  - name: Market
    description: "A market that a company operates in"
    properties:
      - name: name
        type: string
        description: "The name of the market"
relationships:
  - name: competes_with
    description: "A company competes with another company"
    domain: Company
    range: Company
  - name: offers
    description: "A company offers a product or service"
    domain: Company
    range: Product_Service
  - name: operates_in
    description: "A company operates in a market"
    domain: Company
    range: Market
```

## Key Concepts

The ontology is defined by the following key concepts, which are organized into a hierarchical structure in the YAML file.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="`name`">
        **Type:** `string`
        
        The top-level name of the ontology, used to identify it.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="`description`">
        **Type:** `string`
        
        A brief description of the ontology's purpose and scope.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="`entities`">
        **Type:** `list`
        
        A list of entity types that can exist in the knowledge graph. Each entity represents a class of objects.
        <Expandable title="Entity Properties">
            <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
                The name of the entity type (e.g., `Company`, `Product_Service`).
            </ResponseField>
            <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
                A short description of the entity type.
            </ResponseField>
            <ResponseField name="properties" type="list">
                A list of properties associated with the entity type. Each property defines an attribute of the entity.
                <Expandable title="Property Attributes">
                    <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
                        The name of the property (e.g., `ticker`, `description`).
                    </ResponseField>
                    <ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
                        The data type of the property (e.g., `string`, `integer`).
                    </ResponseField>
                    <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
                        A description of the property.
                    </ResponseField>
                </Expandable>
            </ResponseField>
        </Expandable>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="`relationships`">
        **Type:** `list`
        
        A list of relationship types that define how entities can be connected.
        <Expandable title="Relationship Properties">
            <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
                The name of the relationship type (e.g., `competes_with`, `offers`).
            </ResponseField>
            <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
                A short description of what the relationship represents.
            </ResponseField>
            <ResponseField name="domain" type="string" required>
                The source entity type of the relationship.
            </ResponseField>
            <ResponseField name="range" type="string" required>
                The target entity type of the relationship.
            </ResponseField>
        </Expandable>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
